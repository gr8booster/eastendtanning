The user requested a production-ready autonomous AI marketing system for Eastend Tanning & Laundry with comprehensive features across 6 phases. Over multiple iterations, I implemented: complete discount system with smart expiry logic, Fizze drinks online ordering system with delivery integration, SEO optimization across all pages, role-based access control framework, updated location information, added food items to menu, implemented voting system for unavailable items, and corrected phone numbers site-wide. The final issue discovered was a JavaScript error in the Admin dashboard where  function is not properly accessible in the component scope, causing a React error boundary to trigger.
