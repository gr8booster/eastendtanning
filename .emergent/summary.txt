<code_architecture>
**Architecture Overview:**

The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: React SPA with component-based UI, client-side routing, and real-time chat widget
2. **API Layer**: FastAPI REST API with 40+ async endpoints for analytics, chat, payments, authentication, and marketing automation

- User chats with Mary Well → AI processes message → Auto-captures contact info → Starts marketing journey
- User completes skin type evaluation → Result calculated → Stored with recommendations
- User purchases package → Stripe checkout → Payment confirmed → Booking created → Journey advances
- Admin views dashboard → Real-time metrics fetched → Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds
